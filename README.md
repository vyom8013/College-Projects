# 👋 Hello there! I'm Vyom

🎓 I'm a first-year B.Tech student majoring in **Information Technology**

🚀 Always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and collaborate  

## 🔧 Skills I'm Working On
- Python (intermediate level)

- Data Structures and Algorithms (getting the hang of it!)

## 📌 Goals
- Build personal Python projects  
- Contribute to open source (even a small PR counts!)
